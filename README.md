Besides in my work, I'm also strong interested in AI. I love exploring the latest technologies in artificial intelligence and applying them to create innovative solutions. 🚀<br></br>

Check out my GitHub for exciting AI-related projects like:

- [Object Detection]() -  Develop a sentiment analysis model that can analyze the sentiment of social media posts or tweets.
- [Sentiment Analysis]() - Develop a sentiment analysis model that can analyze the sentiment of social media posts or tweets.
- [Chatbot with Natural Language Processing]() - Create a chatbot using natural language processing techniques.

Working on AI projects brings me great joy in life, and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possible can. I hope you like what I work on and that some of it is useful to you. 

If you found anything that I built useful for you or your company, [consider sponsoring me](). ❤️
